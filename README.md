# Presentation JavaScript vs. TypeScript
This presentation is about the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript and what the benefits are to use TypeScript for your projects instead if you are writing single page applications with AngularJS.

As Angular 2 is still in beta state I was using Angular 1.5 for this presentation.
